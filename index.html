            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi! My name is Benedict, but you can call me Ben for short. I am a computer science student at Ontario Tech University.</p>
            <p>When I was young, around third grade, I was passionate about being an inventor in the sense that you could make something that has never been made before and use that to help people who aren't capable or able to do a specific task. But that morphed into something different when I was exposed to computer programming. I was amused by how you could put your heart and soul into a program and would do exactly what you envisioned. What I mean about "heart and soul" is your legacy can be imprinted into your programs for generations to come. My desired legacy is to help people around the world specifically for people who need it, for example, curing the blind, helping second-language speakers and etc. Now I know these examples seem far ways, but someone needs to take the first step closer to these so-called "dreams" even if no one is willing to do it.  </p>
